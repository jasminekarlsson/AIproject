10:53:13.240,Created highlight:, As you saw in Key Concept 2.3 the familiar process of combustion (burning) is similar to the chemical processes that release energy in cells. If glucose is burned in a flame or is in a typical cell it reacts with oxygen gas (O2) forming carbon dioxide and water and releasing energy in the form of heat. The balanced equation for the complete reaction is C6H12O6 + 6 O2 → 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + free energy (ΔG = –686 kcal/mol) This is an oxidation–reduction reaction (more on this shortly) in which glucose loses electrons (becomes oxidized) and oxygen gains them (becomes reduced). The large standard free energy change (ΔG) is negative indicating that the overall conversion is highly exergonic and can drive the endergonic formation of a lot of ATP from ADP and phosphate:,0.034,
